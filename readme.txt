Using Named Pipes in C++

The programs here quickly demonstrate how to use named pipes in C++.  Simply run:

$ make all

then fire up 2 xterms and run the following command in the first xterm:

$ ./simpleOutPipe

and the following command in the second xterm:

$ ./simpleInPipe

You can get more information about these programs from my blog(http://salimhaniff.net/blog/Using-Named-Pipes-In-Cpp#disqus_thread).
