# Using Named Pipes in C++

The programs here quickly demonstrate how to use named pipes in C++.  Simply run:

```sh
$ make all
```
then fire up 2 xterms and run the following command in the first xterm:

```sh
$ ./simpleOutPipe
```
and the following command in the second xterm:
```sh
$ ./simpleInPipe
```

You can get more information about these programs from [my blog](http://salimhaniff.net/blog/Using-Named-Pipes-In-Cpp#disqus_thread).
